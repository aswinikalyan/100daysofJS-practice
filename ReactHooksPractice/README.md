## This is a follow-along practice of the course by John Smilga, to see each hook in practice you must change the import statement in App.js to the corresponding file that you are using 

### These files contain examples of hooks of react
- useState:
- - using array
- - using object
- - counter example
- useEffect:
- - called on every render
- - cleanup function, using a parameterised useEffect to stop callback after first render
